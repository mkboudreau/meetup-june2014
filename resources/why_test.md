* Confidence<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Quality<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

2. quality: 
    1. if using TDD, you can code against your api before you build it
    2. help you design your api
3. documentation:
    1. you get working sample code
4. fun: 
    1. you get some sort of immediate gratification.
    2. you get something up and running quickly
