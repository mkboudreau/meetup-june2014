## Where to Start

* Any test is better than no test<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Transfer logs to tests<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
	
	*&ldquo;Whenever you are tempted to type something into a print statement or a debugger expression, write it as a test instead.&rdquo; (martin fowler)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->*
* Don't let test-first dogmatists get you down<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
* Any test is better than no test<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->

Note:
1. seriously! this was told to me before i really started taking testing seriously. for me personally, this statement took away the fear, the expectations, the shame
2. guys like fowler, robert c. martin (aka uncle bob) -- great insight
3. let's face it... when someone says a statement like "a developer who doesn't test is acting unprofessionally" and your the guy that isn't testing, don't let that get you down. everyone starts somewhere.
