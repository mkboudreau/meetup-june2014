## Agenda

* Why Test
* Go's Built-in Facilities
* Test Frameworks

Note:
1. why test: 
	* I don't want to assume anything about the audience
	* ... so I'd like to spend a minute or two just briefly touching on the importance of testing
2. builtin facilities:
	* what does the language provide?
	* test CLI, benchmarks, example documentation, coverage, detecting race conditions
3. test frameworks
	* ginkgo
	* goconvey
	* gocheck
*  idiomatic: 
	* maybe it is just me, but i feel like i've heard the word "idiomatic" more times in the past 2 1/2 months than I have in the past 15 years of being a developer
	* I've also seen a few misuse/abuses of the term to bolster an argument. 
	* so let's make sure we are on the same page
